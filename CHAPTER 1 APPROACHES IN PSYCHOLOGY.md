CHAPTER 1 APPROACHES IN PSYCHOLOGY

1.1 Origins of psychology: Wundt, introspection and the emergence of psychology as a science

The first lab
The first psychological laboratory was established by Wilhelm Wundt in Leipzig, Germany, in 1879. Wundt's aim was to describe the nature of human consciousness in a carefully controlled and scientific environment – a laboratory.

Introspection
The first systematic attempt to study the mind under controlled conditions. Wundt and his co-workers used introspection to study the mind by breaking up conscious awareness into basic structures of thoughts, images and sensations. This is called structuralism.

Controlled methods
All introspections were recorded under strictly controlled conditions using the same stimulus every time (such as a ticking metronome). The same standardised instructions were issued to all participants, and this allowed procedures to be repeated (replicated) every time.

The emergence of psychology as a science
Watson and the early behaviourists
By the beginning of the 20th century, the value of introspection was questioned by many, most notably the behaviourist John B. Watson (1913).
Watson's main problem with introspection was that it produced data that was subjective, in that it varied from person to person, so it became very difficult to establish general laws.
Watson was also highly critical of introspection's focus on 'private' mental processes and proposed that a truly scientific psychology should instead restrict itself only to studying phenomena that could be observed and measured. Thus, the behaviourist approach was born, and with it the emergence of psychology as a science.

Scientific approach
Watson (1913) and later Skinner (1953) brought the methods of the natural sciences into psychology. The behaviourist focus on the scientific processes involved in learning, alongside the use of carefully controlled laboratory experiments, would go on to dominate the discipline for the next five decades.
Even today, the legacy of the behaviourist approach can be observed in the use of the experimental method in psychology. However, the scope of this research has broadened considerably since the behaviourists' first forays into the lab. Many psychologists still rely on the experimental method as part of their research and although the focus of psychology has changed, the legacy of the behaviourist approach remains.

Evaluation of Wundt and introspection
Scientific method
Some aspects of Wundt's work would be classified as scientific today. For instance, he recorded his introspections within a controlled lab environment. He also standardised his procedures so that all participants received the same information and were tested in the same way. For this reason, Wundt's research can be considered a forerunner to later scientific approaches in psychology, such as the behaviourist approach.

Wundt's methods were unscientific
Other aspects of Wundt’s research would be considered unscientific today. Wundt relied on participants self-reporting their mental processes. Such data is subjective and also participants may have hidden some of their thoughts. It is difficult to establish general laws (principles that apply to all people) from such data. For this reason, Wundt's efforts to study the mind were naive and his results should be treated with caution.

1.2 The behaviourist approach

Assumptions
The behaviourist approach is only interested in studying behaviour that can be observed and measured. It is not concerned with investigating mental processes of the mind. Early behaviourists such as John B. Watson (1913) rejected introspection as it involved too many concepts that were vague and difficult to measure. As a result, behaviourists tried to maintain more control and objectivity within their research and relied on laboratory experiments as the best way to achieve this.
Behaviourists believe that all behaviour is learned. They describe a baby's mind as a 'blank slate' and that this is written on by experience. Following Darwin, behaviourists suggested that the basic processes that govern learning are the same in all species. This meant that in behaviourist research, animals (such as rats and pigeons) could replace humans as experimental subjects. Behaviourists identified two important forms of learning: classical conditioning and operant conditioning.

Classical conditioning – Pavlov’s research
Classical conditioning is learning through association. It was first demonstrated by Ivan Pavlov. Pavlov showed how dogs could be conditioned to salivate to the sound of a bell if that sound was repeatedly presented at the same time as they were given food.
Gradually, Pavlov’s dogs learned to associate the sound of the bell (a neutral stimulus) with the food (an unconditioned stimulus) and would produce the salivation response (conditioned response) every time they heard the sound.
Thus, Pavlov was able to show how a neutral stimulus can come to elicit a new learned response (conditioned response) through association.

Operant conditioning – Skinner’s research
B.F. Skinner (1953) suggested that learning is an active process whereby humans and animals operate on their environment. In operant conditioning, behaviour is shaped by its consequences.

Positive reinforcement is receiving a reward when a certain behaviour is performed; for example, praise from a teacher for answering a question correctly in class.

Negative reinforcement occurs when an animal (or human) avoids something unpleasant. When a student hands in their homework so as not to be shouted at, this is negative reinforcement. The avoidance of something unpleasant is the negative reinforcement.

Punishment is an unpleasant consequence of behaviour, for example being shouted at by the teacher for talking during a lesson. (Finding a way to avoid being shouted at is negative reinforcement).

Positive and negative reinforcement increase the likelihood that behaviour will be repeated. Punishment decreases the likelihood that behaviour will be repeated.

The Skinner Box
Skinner conducted experiments with rats, and sometimes pigeons, in specially designed cages called Skinner boxes. Every time the rat activated a lever (or a pigeon pecked a disc) within the box it was rewarded with a food pellet. From then on the animal would continue to perform the behaviour.
Skinner also showed how rats and pigeons could be conditioned to perform the same behaviour to avoid an unpleasant stimulus, for example an electric shock.

Evaluation of the behaviourist approach
Well-controlled research
Behaviourists focused on the measurement of observable behaviour within highly controlled lab settings. By breaking down behaviour into basic stimulus-response units, all other possible extraneous variables were removed, allowing cause-and-effect relationships to be established. For instance, Skinner was able to clearly demonstrate how reinforcement determined an animal’s behaviour. This suggests that behaviourist experiments have scientific credibility.

Real-world application
The principles of conditioning have been applied to real-world behaviours and problems. For example, operant conditioning is the basis of token economy systems that have been used successfully in institutions, such as prisons and psychiatric wards. These work by rewarding appropriate behaviour with tokens that can then be exchanged for privileges. This increases the value of the behaviourist approach because it has widespread application.

Environmental determinism
The behaviourist approach sees all behaviour as conditioned by past conditioning experiences. Skinner suggested that everything we do is the sum total of our reinforcement history. When we think we are making a decision to do something, Skinner would say that our past conditioning history determined the outcome. This ignores any possible influence that free will may have on behaviour. This is an extreme position and ignores the influence of conscious decision-making processes on behaviour.

1.3 Social learning theory

Assumptions
Albert Bandura proposed the social learning theory (SLT) as a development of the behaviourist approach. He agreed with the behaviourists that much of our behaviour is learned from experience. However, his SLT proposed a different way in which people learn: through observation and imitation of others within a social context, hence social learning. SLT suggested that learning occurs directly, through classical and operant conditioning, but also indirectly.

Vicarious reinforcement
For indirect learning to take place, an individual observes the behaviour of others. The learner may imitate this behaviour but, in general, imitation only occurs if the behaviour is seen to be rewarded (reinforced) rather than punished. Thus, the learner observes a behaviour but most importantly observes the consequences of a behaviour. This is called vicarious reinforcement.

The role of mediational processes
SLT is often described as the 'bridge' between traditional learning theory and the cognitive approach because it focuses on how mental (cognitive) factors are involved in learning. These mental factors mediate (i.e. intervene) in the learning process to determine whether a new response is acquired.
Four mediational processes in learning were identified by Bandura:

Attention – the extent to which we notice certain behaviours.

Retention – how well the behaviour is remembered.

Motor reproduction – the ability of the observer to perform the behaviour.

Motivation – the will to perform the behaviour, which is often determined by whether the behaviour was rewarded or punished.

The first two of these relate to the learning of the behaviour and the last two with the performance of the behaviour. Unlike traditional behaviourism, the learning and performance of behaviour do not need to occur at the same time. Observed behaviours may be stored by the observer and reproduced at a later time.

Identification
People (especially children) are much more likely to imitate the behaviour of people with whom they identify, called role models. This process is called modelling. A person becomes a role model if they are seen to possess similar characteristics to the observer and/or are attractive and have high status. Role models may not necessarily be physically present in the environment, and this has important implications for the influence of the media on behaviour.

Bandura’s research
Bobo doll study 1
Bandura et al. (1961) recorded the behaviour of young children who watched an adult behave in an aggressive way towards a Bobo doll. The adult hit the doll with a hammer and shouted abuse at it.
When these children were later observed playing with various toys, including a Bobo doll, they behaved much more aggressively towards the doll and the other toys than those who had observed a non-aggressive adult.

Bobo doll study 2
Bandura and Walters (1963) showed children videos where an adult was aggressive to a Bobo doll. One group of children saw the adult praised for their behaviour (told 'Well done'). A second group saw the adult punished for their aggression by being scolded. The third group (control group) saw the aggression without any consequence.
When given their own Bobo doll to play with, the first group showed much more aggression, followed by the third group and then the second.

Evaluation of social learning theory
Cognitive factors
Neither classical nor operant conditioning can offer an adequate account of learning on their own. Humans and many animals store information about the behaviour of others and use this to make judgements about when it is appropriate to perform certain actions. As Bandura (1977) observed: 'Learning would be exceedingly hazardous, not to mention wearisome, if people had to rely solely on the effects of their own actions to inform them what to do.' (Bandura 1977). This suggests that SLT provides a more comprehensive explanation of human learning by recognising the role of mediational processes.

Contrived lab studies
Many of Bandura's ideas were developed through observation of young children's behaviour in lab settings. Lab studies are often criticised for their contrived nature where participants may respond to demand characteristics. It has been suggested, in relation to the Bobo doll research, that because the main purpose of the doll is to strike it, the children were simply behaving in a way that they thought was expected. This suggests that the research may tell us little about how children actually learn aggression in everyday life.

Real-world application
Social learning theory has the advantage of being able to explain cultural differences in behaviour. Social learning principles can account for how children learn from individuals around them, as well as through the media, and this can explain how cultural norms are transmitted through particular societies. This has proved useful in understanding a range of behaviours, such as how children come to understand their gender role. This increases the value of the approach as it can explain real-world behaviour.

1.4 The cognitive approach

Assumptions
In direct contrast to the behaviourist approach, the cognitive approach argues that internal mental processes can, and should, be studied scientifically. As a result, the cognitive approach has investigated those areas of human behaviour that were neglected by behaviourists, such as memory, perception and thinking. These processes are 'private' and cannot be observed, so cognitive psychologists study them indirectly by making inferences about what is going on inside people’s minds on the basis of their behaviour.

The role of schema
Cognitive processing can often be affected by a person’s beliefs or expectations, often referred to as schema. These are 'packages' of ideas and information developed through experience. They act as a mental framework for the interpretation of incoming information received by the cognitive system; for example, you have a schema for a chair – something with legs that you can sit on. This helps you respond to the object appropriately.
Babies are born with simple motor schema for innate behaviours such as sucking and grasping. As we get older, our schema become more detailed and sophisticated. Adults have developed mental representations for everything from the concept of psychology to a schema for what happens in a restaurant or a post office.
Schema allow us to process lots of information quickly and this is useful as a sort of mental short-cut that prevents us from being overwhelmed by environmental stimuli. However, schema may also distort our interpretations of sensory information, leading to perceptual errors.

Theoretical and computer models
Cognitive psychologists use both theoretical and computer models to help them understand internal mental processes. There are overlaps between these two, though theoretical models are abstract whereas computer models are concrete things.
One important theoretical model is the information processing approach, which suggests that information flows through the cognitive system in a sequence of stages that include input, storage and retrieval, as in the multi-store model.
The cognitive approach also uses computer models where the mind is compared to a computer (the computer analogy) by suggesting that there are similarities in the way information is processed. These models use the concepts of a central processing unit (the brain), coding (to turn information into a useable format) and 'stores' (to hold information). Such computational models of the mind have proved useful in the development of artificial intelligence.

The emergence of cognitive neuroscience
Cognitive neuroscience is the scientific study of the influence of brain structures on mental processes.
Mapping brain areas to specific cognitive functions has a long history in psychology. As early as the 1860s, Paul Broca had identified how damage to an area of the frontal lobe (which came to be known as Broca's area) could permanently impair speech production.
However, it is only in the last twenty years, with advances in brain imaging techniques such as fMRI and PET scans, that scientists have been able to systematically observe and describe the neurological basis of mental processes.
For example, in research involving tasks that required the use of episodic and semantic memory, Buckner and Petersen (1996) were able to show how these different types of long-term memory may be located on opposite sides of the prefrontal cortex. As well as this, the system in charge of overall concentration and attention (the central executive) is thought to be located in a similar area (Braver et al. 1997).
Scanning techniques have also proved useful in establishing the neurological basis of some mental disorders. For example, the link between the parahippocampal gyrus and OCD.
The focus of cognitive neuroscience has recently expanded to include the use of computer-generated models that are designed to 'read' the brain. This has led to the development of mind mapping techniques known as 'brain fingerprinting'. One possible future application of this could be to analyse the brain wave patterns of eyewitnesses in court to determine whether they are lying.

Evaluation of the cognitive approach
Scientific methods
The cognitive approach has always employed highly objective and controlled methods of study so researchers are able to infer cognitive processes at work. This has involved the use of lab studies to produce reliable, objective data. In addition, the emergence of cognitive neuroscience has enabled the two fields of biology and cognitive psychology to come together to enhance the scientific basis of study. This means that the study of the mind has a credible scientific basis.

Application to everyday life
As we have seen, the cognitive approach is the dominant approach in psychology today and has been applied to a wide range of practical and theoretical contexts. For example, cognitive psychology has made an important contribution in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) and the development of robots, exciting advances that may likely revolutionise how we live in the future. Cognitive principles have also been applied to the treatment of depression and improving the reliability of eyewitness testimony. This supports the value of the approach.

Machine reductionism
Although there are similarities between the human mind and the operations of a 'thinking machine' (inputs and outputs, storage systems, the use of a central processor), the computer analogy has been criticised by many. Such machine reductionism ignores the influence of human emotion and motivation on the cognitive system, and how this may affect our ability to process information. For instance, research has found that human memory may be affected by emotional factors, such as the influence of anxiety on eyewitnesses.

1.5 The biological approach

Assumptions
The biological approach suggests that everything psychological is at first biological, so to fully understand human behaviour we must look to biological structures and processes within the body, such as genes, neurochemistry and the nervous system.
An understanding of brain structure and function can explain our thoughts and behaviour. From a biological perspective, the mind lives in the brain – meaning that all thoughts, feelings and behaviour ultimately have a physical basis. This is in contrast to the cognitive approach that sees mental processes of the mind as being separate from the physical brain.

The genetic basis of behaviour
Behavioural geneticists study whether behavioural characteristics, such as intelligence, personality, mental disorders, etc., are inherited in the same way as physical characteristics such as height and eye colour.
Twin studies are used to determine the likelihood that certain traits have a genetic basis by comparing the concordance rates between pairs of twins; that is, the extent to which both twins share the same characteristic.
If identical (monozygotic – MZ) twins are found to have higher concordance rates than non-identical (dizygotic – DZ) twins – for musical ability, schizophrenia, etc. – this would suggest a genetic basis. This is because MZ twins share 100% of each other’s genes, whilst DZ twins share about 50% (the same as any other siblings).

Genotype and phenotype
A person’s genotype is their actual genetic make-up, whereas phenotype is the way that genes are expressed through physical, behavioural and psychological characteristics.
The expression of a genotype is inevitably influenced by environmental factors. For example, identical twins may look slightly different because one has exercised more or one has dyed their hair.
So, despite having the same genes, the way identical twins' genes are expressed (the phenotype) is different. This illustrates what many biological psychologists accept, that much of human behaviour depends upon an interaction between inherited factors (nature) and the environment (nurture).

Evolution and behaviour
The evolution of human behaviour is the same as the evolution of physical characteristics. Charles Darwin (1859) proposed the theory of natural selection. He argued that any genetically determined behaviour that enhances an individual’s survival (and reproduction) will continue in future generations, i.e. be naturally selected.
In nature, this selection takes place 'naturally' – no one 'decides' which characteristics are beneficial. The possessor of the beneficial trait simply survives, reproduces and passes on the trait. If the individual survives but does not reproduce, the traits do not remain in the gene pool.

Evaluation of the biological approach
Scientific methods
In order to investigate the genetic and biological basis of behaviour, the biological approach makes use of a range of precise and highly objective methods. These include scanning techniques, such as fMRI and EEGs, family and twin studies, and drug trials. With advances in technology, it is possible to accurately measure physiological and neural processes in ways that are not open to bias. This means that much of the biological approach is based on objective and reliable data.

Real-world application
Increased understanding of neurochemical processes in the brain is associated with the use of psychoactive drugs to treat serious mental disorders, such as depression. For example, the biological approach has promoted the treatment of clinical depression using antidepressant drugs that increase levels of the neurotransmitter serotonin at synapses in the brain. Such drugs have been associated with the reduction of depressive symptoms and this means that sufferers are able to manage their condition and live a relatively normal life.

Biological determinism
The biological approach is determinist in that it sees human behaviour as governed by internal, genetic causes over which we have no control. We have already seen that the way a person’s genotype is expressed (their phenotype) is heavily influenced by the environment. Not even identical twins look the same and think the same. Also, a purely genetic argument becomes problematic for things such as crime. Could a 'criminal gene' ever be used as a legal defence? The biological approach takes an efficient but simplistic view that ignores the mediating effects of the environment.

1.6 The psychodynamic approach

The role of the unconscious
Sigmund Freud suggested that most of our mind is made up of the unconscious: a vast storehouse of biological drives and instincts that has a significant influence on our behaviour and personality. The unconscious also contains threatening and disturbing memories that have been repressed, or locked away and forgotten. These can be accessed during dreams or through 'slips of the tongue' (what Freud called parapraxes).
Underneath the surface of our conscious mind is the preconscious, which contains thoughts and memories which are not currently in conscious awareness but we can access if we desire.

The structure of personality
Freud described personality as tripartite, composed of three parts:

The Id is the primitive part of our personality. It operates on the pleasure principle – the id gets what it wants. It is a seething mass of unconscious drives and instincts. Only the id is present at birth. Throughout life the id is selfish and demands instant gratification of its needs.

The Ego works on the reality principle and is the mediator between the other two parts of the personality. The ego develops around the age of two years and its role is to reduce the conflict between the demands of the id and the superego. It manages this by employing a number of defence mechanisms.

The Superego is formed at the end of the phallic stage, around the age of five. It is our internalised sense of right and wrong. Based on the morality principle, it represents the moral standards of the child's same-sex parent and punishes the ego for any wrongdoing (through guilt).

Psychosexual stages
Freud claimed that child development occurred in five stages. Each stage (apart from latency) is marked by a different conflict that the child must resolve in order to progress successfully to the next stage. Any psychosexual conflict that is unresolved leads to fixation where the child becomes 'stuck' and carries certain behaviours and conflicts associated with that stage through to adult life.

Oral (0–1 years) – Focus of pleasure is the mouth, mother's breast is the object of desire. Fixation: smoking, biting nails, sarcastic, critical.

Anal (1–3 years) – Focus of pleasure is the anus. The child gains pleasure from withholding and expelling faeces. Fixation: Anal retentive – perfectionist, obsessive; Anal expulsive – thoughtless, messy.

Phallic (3–6 years) – Focus of pleasure is the genital area. Child experiences the Oedipus or Electra complex. Fixation: Phallic personality – narcissistic, reckless, possibly homosexual.

Latency – Earlier conflicts are repressed.

Genital – Sexual desires become conscious alongside the onset of puberty. Fixation: difficulty forming heterosexual relationships.

Defence mechanisms
The ego has a difficult job balancing the conflicting demands of the id and the superego. However, it has help in the form of defence mechanisms. These are unconscious and ensure that the ego is able to prevent us from being overwhelmed by temporary threats or traumas. However, they often involve some form of distortion of reality and as a long-term solution they are regarded as psychologically unhealthy and undesirable.

Repression – Forcing a distressing memory out of the conscious mind.

Denial – Refusing to acknowledge some aspect of reality.

Displacement – Transferring feelings from true source of distressing emotion onto a substitute target.

Evaluation of the psychodynamic approach
Real-world application
Freud's approach was the first to look at the psychological causes of mental disorders. He developed a new form of therapy, psychoanalysis, which was the forerunner to many modern-day psychotherapies. This was a 'talking cure' that aimed to access the unconscious and resolve internal conflicts. While it may not be suitable for people with more serious mental disorders (such as schizophrenia), it has been used with success by many people with milder disorders.

Explanatory power
Freud's theory has had a huge influence on psychology and Western contemporary thought. It has been used to explain a wide range of phenomena including personality development, abnormal behaviour, moral development and gender. The approach is also significant in drawing attention to the connection between experiences in childhood, such as our relationship with our parents, and our later development.

Untestable concepts
The philosopher of science Karl Popper argued that the psychodynamic approach does not meet the scientific criterion of falsification. It is not open to empirical testing (and the possibility of being proved false). Many of Freud's concepts (such as the id and the Oedipus complex) are said to occur at an unconscious level, making them impossible to test. For this reason, Popper afforded the psychodynamic approach a 'pseudoscience' status rather than a real science.

The use of case studies
Freud's theory was based on the intensive study of single individuals (such as Little Hans). Although Freud's observations were detailed and carefully recorded, critics have suggested that it is not possible to make such universal claims about human nature based on studies of such a small number of individuals who were psychologically abnormal. Furthermore, Freud's interpretations were highly subjective; it is unlikely, in the case of Little Hans for instance, that any other researcher would have drawn the same conclusions. Freud’s methods lack scientific rigour.

1.7 Humanistic psychology

Free will
All the other approaches we have looked at are determinist to some degree in their suggestion that our behaviour is entirely shaped by forces over which we have no control. Humanistic psychology is quite different in this respect, claiming that human beings are self-determining and have free will.
This does not mean that people are not affected by external or internal influences but we are active agents who have the ability to determine our own development. For this reason, humanistic psychologists reject scientific models that attempt to establish general principles of human behaviour. As active agents we are all unique, and psychology should concern itself with the study of subjective experience rather than general laws. This is often referred to as a person-centred approach in psychology.

Self-actualisation
Every person has an innate tendency to achieve their full potential – to become the best they can possibly be. Self-actualisation represents the uppermost level of Maslow’s hierarchy of needs. All four lower levels of the hierarchy ('deficiency needs') must be met before the individual can work towards self-actualisation (a 'growth need') and fulfil their potential.
Humanistic psychologists regard personal growth as an essential part of what it is to be human. Personal growth is concerned with developing and changing as a person to become fulfilled, satisfied and goal-orientated. Not everyone will manage this, however, and there are important psychological barriers that may prevent a person from reaching their potential.

The self, congruence and worth
Carl Rogers argued that for personal growth to be achieved an individual’s concept of self (the way they see themselves) must be broadly equivalent to, or have congruence with, their ideal self (the person they want to be). If too big a gap exists between the two 'selves' the person will experience a state of incongruence and self-actualisation will not be possible due to the negative feelings of self-worth that arise from incongruence.
In order to reduce the gap between the self-concept and the ideal self, Rogers developed client-centred therapy (CCT) – also called 'counselling' – to help people cope with the problems of everyday living. Rogers claimed that many of the issues we experience as adults, such as worthlessness and low self-esteem, have their roots in childhood and can often be explained by a lack of unconditional positive regard (or lack of unconditional love) from our parents. A parent who sets boundaries or limits on their love for their child (conditions of worth), by saying 'I will only love you if...', is storing up psychological problems for that child in the future. Thus, Rogers saw one of his roles as an effective therapist as being able to provide his clients with the unconditional positive regard that they had failed to receive as children.

Evaluation of humanistic psychology
Not reductionist Humanistic psychologists advocate holism, the idea that subjective experience can only be understood by considering the whole person. This approach may have more validity than its alternatives by considering meaningful human behaviour within its real-life context.

Limited real-world application
It is true that Rogers' person-centred therapy has revolutionised counselling techniques and Maslow’s hierarchy of needs has been used to explain motivation, particularly in the workplace. However, it remains the case that the approach has had relatively little impact on the discipline of psychology as a whole. This may be in part because humanistic psychology lacks a sound evidence-base and also because the approach has been described, not as a comprehensive theory, but as a loose set of rather abstract concepts.

Positive approach
Humanistic psychologists have been praised for 'bringing the person back into psychology' and promoting a positive image of the human condition. Freud saw human beings as slaves to their past and claimed all of us existed somewhere between 'unhappy and absolute despair'. Humanistic psychology offers a refreshing and optimistic alternative; it sees all people as basically good, free to work towards the achievement of their potential and in control of their lives.

Untestable concepts
Humanistic psychology does include a number of vague ideas that are abstract and difficult to test. Concepts such as 'self-actualisation' and 'congruence' may be useful therapeutic tools but are problematic to assess under experimental conditions. Rogers did attempt to introduce more rigour into his work by developing the Q-sort – an objective measure of progress in therapy. Nevertheless, as would be expected of an approach that describes itself as anti-scientific, humanistic psychology is short on empirical evidence to support its claims.

Western-cultural bias
Many of the ideas that are central to humanistic psychology, such as individual freedom, autonomy and personal growth, would be much more readily associated with individualist cultures in the Western world such as the US. Collectivist cultures, such as India, which emphasise the needs of the group, community and interdependence, may not identify so easily with the ideals and values of humanistic psychology. Therefore, it is possible that this approach would not travel well and is a product of the cultural context within which it was developed.

1.8 Comparison of approaches

Approach

Determinism

Nature vs Nurture

Reductionism

Scientific methods

Treatment of abnormal behaviour

Behaviourist

Deterministic. All behaviour is environmentally determined by external forces we cannot control (reinforcement and punishment).

Nurture. Humans are born as a 'blank slate' and all behaviour is learned through experience (classical and operant conditioning).

Reductionist. Breaks up complex behaviour into stimulus-response units for ease of testing in the lab.

Scientific. Highly objective and experimental, focusing on responses that can be observed and measured.

Behaviour therapy. Based on conditioning. Systematic desensitisation and flooding are based on classical conditioning. Token economies are based on operant conditioning.

Social Learning

Reciprocal determinism. We are influenced by our environment, but we also exert some influence upon it through the behaviours we choose to perform.

Nurture. Behaviour is learned through observation and imitation within a social context.

Reductionist. Like the behaviourist approach, it reduces complex learning to a handful of key processes (imitation, modelling, etc.) though it does at least recognise the role of cognitive factors.

Scientific. Reliable and objective.

Little application. Though social learning principles have been used to explain how children learn their gender role.

Cognitive

Soft determinism. We are free to think before we respond to a stimulus, but this is within the limits of what we know (our experience).

Nature and Nurture. Recognises that many of our information-processing abilities are innate (nature) but are constantly refined through experience (nurture).

Machine reductionism. Use of the computer analogy and the reduction of complex cognitive processes to the level of bits of information.

Scientific. Generally uses objective and controlled laboratory research, which allows researchers to infer internal mental processes.

Cognitive therapy. For example, cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) has been used in the treatment of depression and many other disorders.

Biological

Genetic determinism. Much of our behaviour is directed by innate influences (genes) and is also subject to the influence of our chemistry and brain structure.

Nature. Behaviour is the result of innate biological factors (genes, hormones, etc.).

Biological reductionism. Explains all psychological phenomena at the level of genes, hormones and neurotransmitters.

Scientific. Uses highly reliable and objective methods, e.g. fMRI, PET and blood tests.

Drug therapy. Based on the idea that neurotransmitters in the brain are involved in some mental disorders, e.g. the role of serotonin in OCD.

Psychodynamic

Psychic determinism. Human behaviour is directed by unconscious conflicts, repressed in childhood.

Nature and Nurture. Focuses on the role of innate biological drives (nature) but also the way we are raised by our parents (nurture).

Reductionist and Holistic. Relies on a relatively small number of innate drives but Freud’s use of the case study method is essentially holistic.

Not scientific. Many of the key concepts (e.g. the id) are not open to empirical testing.

Psychoanalysis. Freud’s 'talking cure' designed to access the unconscious mind. Though not suitable for everyone, it has had some success.

Humanistic

Free will. Human beings are self-determining and free to choose their own thoughts and actions.

Nature and Nurture. Recognises the influence of nature (drive to self-actualise) and nurture (the influence of experiences with parents).

Holistic. Focuses on the individual’s subjective experience and 'the whole person'.

Not scientific. Rejects the scientific method as not capable of capturing the importance and meaning of conscious experience.

Client-centred therapy. An effective therapy that aims to close the gap between the self-concept and the ideal self to achieve personal growth.
